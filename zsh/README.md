The Z shell
===========

Oh! man the Z shell is soo amazing. I use it all the time.
I typically use it along with the customizations from [Oh My
Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) by Robbie Russel with a few
tweaks of my own.

> I have also added my own custom version of the `robbyrussel` zsh theme
> here!
