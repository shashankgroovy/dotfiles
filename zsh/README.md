The Z shell
===========

Oh! man the Z shell is soo amazing. I use it all the time.
I typically use it along with the customizations from
[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh](Oh My Zsh) by Robbie Russel with a
few tweaks of my own

> I have also added my own custom version of the `robbyrussel` zsh theme
> here!
