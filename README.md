Dotfiles
--------

Aha! My .dotfiles for all GNU/Linux based distributions.

Contains the configurations for the following:

```
1. bash             -- Borne Again! Puff! Not Jason Borne :P
2. vim              -- Vim you lovely motherf**ker.
3. zsh              -- Damn! right. Oh my Zsh!
4. tmux             -- Termial multiplexer
```

### Todo :
* Make a `shell script` to do all the dirty work. :D
* Update the bin with `fasd`.

### Screenshots
> Look inside each of the folders to find the respective screenshots :D

Time to hack! \m/
